# # ðŸ“š Book Recommendation System

This is a Streamlit web app that recommends books based on the genre or keywords you input. Instead of simple matching, it uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and **cosine similarity** to find books with the most similar genres or themes.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. TF-IDF is used to vectorize the `Book-Genre` column.
2. User input (genre/keywords) is also vectorized.
3. Cosine similarity measures closeness between the input and all book genres.
4. Top similar books are recommended.
